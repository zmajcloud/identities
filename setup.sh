# A script to add two public keys to the authorized_keys file.

# --- Main Logic ---

# 1. Check if exactly two arguments (the public key files) are provided.
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <account_name>"
    exit 1
fi
# Assign the file paths to variables for clarity.
ACCOUNT_NAME=$1

# --- Configuration ---
# The directory where SSH keys are stored.
# SSH_DIR="/home/$(ACOUNT_NAME)/.ssh"
SSH_DIR="/home/${ACCOUNT_NAME}/.ssh"
# The file that stores authorized public keys.
AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE="${SSH_DIR}/authorized_keys"

KEY1="$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zmajcloud/identities/refs/heads/master/accounts/${ACCOUNT_NAME}_1.pub)"
KEY1="$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zmajcloud/identities/refs/heads/master/accounts/${ACCOUNT_NAME}_2.pub)"

# 2. Verify that both provided files exist and are readable.
if [ ! -f "$KEY1" ] || [ ! -r "$KEY1" ]; then
    echo "Error: Public key file '$KEY1' does not exist or is not readable."
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f "$KEY2" ] || [ ! -r "$KEY2" ]; then
    echo "Error: Public key file '$KEY2' does not exist or is not readable."
    exit 1
fi

# 3. Ensure the .ssh directory exists and has the correct permissions (700).
#    This prevents other users on the system from accessing it.
if [ ! -d "$SSH_DIR" ]; then
    echo "Creating directory: $SSH_DIR"
    mkdir -p "$SSH_DIR"
    chmod 700 "$SSH_DIR"
fi

# 4. Ensure the authorized_keys file exists and has the correct permissions (600).
#    This prevents other users from reading or writing to it.
if [ ! -f "$AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Creating file: $AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE"
    touch "$AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE"
    chmod 600 "$AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE"
fi

# 5. Concatenate the contents of the two key files and append them to authorized_keys.
#    Using 'cat' and '>>' ensures each key is added on a new line.
echo "Adding keys to $AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE..."
cat "$KEY1" "$KEY2" >> "$AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE"

# 6. Add a newline to the end of the file just in case the key files didn't have one.
#    This is good practice to prevent issues with future additions.

echo "âœ… Success! Both public keys have been added to your authorized_keys file."
